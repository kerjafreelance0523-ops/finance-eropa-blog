Several research desks and commentators have published Bitcoin price targets in the 150k range for 2026 or beyond.

## Where 150k forecasts come from

Targets in this range often rely on ETF and institutional flows, post-halving supply, and historical cycles. These are scenarios, not guarantees.

## What could go wrong

Regulatory or tax changes, a sharp risk-off move in global markets, or lower-than-expected ETF inflows could all pressure prices.

## How to use these targets

Treat 150k (or any single number) as a possible scenario, not a forecast you should bet the farm on. Align position size with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
