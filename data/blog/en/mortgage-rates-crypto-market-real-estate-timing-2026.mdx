When to buy or refinance real estate in 2026 depends on more than mortgage rates alone. Rates have fallen to around 6% in early 2026, opening refinance opportunities for millions of borrowers; at the same time, research from the Office of Financial Research and BNB has shown that zip codes with high crypto exposure saw the largest increases in mortgage originations and balances in recent years. So the interplay between rates, crypto wealth, and household leverage is real. This article summarises the data on mortgage rates and refinance eligibility, the link between crypto exposure and mortgage borrowing, and how Fed policy can affect both rates and crypto. It then outlines two forward-looking scenarios so you can time decisions with clarity.

According to the February 2026 Mortgage Monitor, rates near 6.04% in January made nearly 4.8 million borrowers eligible to refinance—a sharp jump from the prior month. Housing affordability improved to a four-year high, though home price-to-income ratios remain elevated (around 4.8:1 versus a long-run average near 4:1). U.S. home price growth slowed to about 0.6% in 2025, the weakest in over a decade, with wide regional variation. So the data paints a mixed picture: better affordability from lower rates, but still stretched valuations and some markets with modest negative equity. For crypto holders, OFR research indicates that low-income households in high-crypto-exposure areas saw mortgage share and average balances rise sharply (over 250% and 150% respectively in a 2020–2024 window); delinquency rates had not yet risen as of the data cut, but the leverage build-up is a risk if crypto corrects. Grayscale and others note that Bitcoin’s path in 2026 may range from roughly $70,000 to $170,000 depending on Fed policy, so timing real estate against both rates and crypto is relevant.

## Data and Source: Rates, Refinance Eligibility, and Crypto Exposure

As shown in the chart below, mortgage rates in 2024–2026 have moved from multi-year highs toward the 6% range, with a clear step up in refinance eligibility when rates crossed below certain thresholds. The Mortgage Monitor (February 2026) reports that in January 2026 rates reached 6.04%, enabling nearly 4.8 million borrowers to refinance—about 20% more eligible overnight. That figure is a concrete anchor for “when” to consider refinancing: if you are in that pool, the math may favor locking in a new rate. The implication is that waiting for further rate cuts can backfire if rates tick up; conversely, locking at current levels can remove rate risk even if the Fed cuts again later.

Crypto exposure adds a second dimension. OFR and BNB research has documented that areas with high crypto adoption saw the largest increases in mortgage originations and balances in subsequent years. Low-income households in those zip codes showed particularly large gains in mortgage share and balances. The data does not yet show a spike in delinquencies, but it does show that crypto gains have been used to support more borrowing. So the link between crypto wealth and real estate leverage is empirical, not just anecdotal. For timing, the takeaway is that if you have used crypto gains to fund a down payment or to qualify for a larger mortgage, a sharp crypto correction could strain your finances even if your job is stable. So “when to buy” is not only about rates; it is about your mix of income, crypto, and debt.

## Historical Context: Rate Cycles and House Prices

Historically, mortgage rate cycles and house prices have been inversely related: when rates fall, affordability improves and demand often rises; when rates rise, demand can cool and price growth can slow. The 2022–2024 tightening cycle pushed rates to multi-year highs; the subsequent drift down in 2025–2026 has improved affordability but has not fully reversed the run-up in home prices. So we are in a phase where affordability is better than it was but still stretched by long-run standards. The difference in 2026 is the role of crypto: past cycles did not have a large cohort of households with crypto-backed wealth and leverage. The similarity is that rate levels still drive refinance and purchase incentives; the new layer is that crypto-driven equity and borrowing can amplify both upside and downside depending on crypto’s path.

Fed policy influences both mortgage rates and crypto. Research summarized by Gate and others indicates that cryptocurrency prices are sensitive to Fed decisions; bond market volatility and rate expectations feed through to crypto valuations. So when the Fed cuts, rates can fall (good for refinance and affordability) and crypto can rally (supporting household balance sheets in high-exposure areas). When the Fed holds or hikes, the opposite can occur. Historical comparison therefore suggests that timing real estate in 2026 should account for both the rate path and the crypto-macro link, not only one or the other.

## Contrarian Angle: Rates Are Not the Only Variable

While many time real estate decisions purely on mortgage rates, data on crypto exposure and household leverage suggests that a single-factor view is incomplete. The popular narrative is “rates are down, so buy or refinance.” A closer look at OFR and BNB research shows that in high-crypto-exposure areas, mortgage growth has been outsized and that a portion of that growth is likely tied to crypto wealth. So the contrarian take is not that rates don’t matter—they do—but that your personal balance sheet matters as much. If a lot of your equity or qualification power came from crypto, a big correction could stress your ability to hold the mortgage even at a 6% rate. So “when to buy” should include a stress test: what happens to your finances if rates stay here but crypto drops 40%? If the answer is uncomfortable, you may want to reduce leverage or delay a marginal purchase.

Another angle: some assume that crypto and real estate are unrelated. The data says otherwise—crypto exposure and mortgage growth are correlated at the zip-code level. So the contrarian point is to stop treating real estate timing as a rates-only decision and to incorporate your crypto exposure and risk tolerance. That may mean refinancing to lock in a rate and reduce payment shock, or it may mean not stretching for a larger home if the down payment was mostly crypto gains that could reverse.

## Forward-Looking Scenarios: Fed Cut Versus Hold and Correction

Two scenarios help with planning. In the first, the Fed cuts further in 2026. Mortgage rates could drift lower, refinance eligibility could expand again, and affordability could improve. Crypto might benefit from a looser financial conditions environment (Grayscale’s range includes upside toward $170K depending on policy). In that world, locking in a refinance or moving forward with a purchase can make sense, especially if you are not over-leveraged. In the second scenario, the Fed holds or inflation stays sticky, and crypto corrects from current levels. Then households that used crypto gains to qualify for or size up a mortgage could face pressure: same payment, but less crypto wealth and possibly lower liquidity. Delinquencies could rise in high-exposure areas even if employment holds. The implication is to size your mortgage and down payment so that you can service debt from income and a portion of savings, not only from crypto. That way you are resilient in both scenarios.

Forward-looking, the link between Fed policy, mortgage rates, and crypto is likely to persist. Using a two-scenario framework (Fed cut and benign crypto vs. Fed hold and crypto correction) helps you decide whether to refinance now, wait, or reduce leverage. The practical takeaway is to combine rate-based timing with a clear view of your own crypto exposure and to avoid over-leveraging on the assumption that crypto will always support your balance sheet.

## Conclusion and Takeaways

Mortgage rates near 6% in early 2026 have improved affordability and expanded refinance eligibility (e.g., nearly 4.8 million borrowers in one snapshot). Data from the Mortgage Monitor, OFR, and BNB research shows that crypto exposure is correlated with mortgage growth: high-exposure zip codes saw large increases in originations and balances. So timing real estate in 2026 is not only about rates; it is about your mix of income, crypto, and debt. Historically, rate cycles drive refinance and purchase incentives; the new layer is crypto-driven leverage. The contrarian point is that rates alone are not enough—stress-test for a crypto correction. Two scenarios matter: Fed cut and supportive crypto (refinance or buy with eyes open) and Fed hold plus crypto correction (avoid over-leverage). Practical takeaways are to lock in a refinance if you are eligible and the math works, to size mortgages so you can service them without relying on crypto, and to use both rate and crypto scenarios when deciding when to buy or refinance in 2026.

Key takeaways: (1) Use current rate levels and refinance eligibility data to decide whether to refinance now. (2) Factor in your crypto exposure and stress-test for a correction. (3) Prefer a mortgage size you can service from income and non-crypto savings. Mortgage rates and crypto in 2026 are linked through the Fed and household balance sheets; aligning your timing with both leads to better decisions.
