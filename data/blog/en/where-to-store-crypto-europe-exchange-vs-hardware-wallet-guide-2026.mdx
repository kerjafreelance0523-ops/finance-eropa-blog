Many European investors buy their first Bitcoin on an exchange and have no idea what to do next. Should you leave it there or move to a hardware wallet?

The short answer depends on how much you hold, how often you trade, and how much responsibility you want for your own keys. Exchanges are custodial: they hold your crypto and you trust their security and solvency. A hardware wallet is non-custodial: you hold the private keys and the device signs transactions offline. Each option has trade-offs. This guide explains the risks of both and when to use which, so you can decide with clarity.

## Risks of keeping everything on an exchange

When your crypto sits on an exchange, the platform controls the private keys. You rely on their security, their policies, and their ability to honour withdrawals. Exchanges can be hacked, go bankrupt, or freeze accounts for regulatory or internal reasons. In the EU, licensed exchanges must comply with MiCA and national rules, which improves transparency and recourse, but does not eliminate risk. If the exchange is compromised or insolvent, your balance can be at risk even if you did nothing wrong. So keeping large or long-term holdings entirely on one exchange is generally not recommended.

A practical rule many investors follow is to keep only what you need for trading or short-term moves on an exchange. The rest—especially amounts you plan to hold for years—is better moved to a wallet you control. That way, you limit exposure to exchange risk while still using the platform for buying, selling, and rebalancing when needed.

## Risk of losing your private key (non-custodial)

With a hardware or software wallet that you control, you alone hold the private key or seed phrase. That means no third party can move your funds without your approval, but it also means you are fully responsible. If you lose the seed phrase or the device and have no backup, your crypto is permanently lost. There is no “forgot password” or support ticket that can recover it. Hardware wallets reduce the risk of online theft (your keys never touch the internet in plain form) but do not protect you from losing the backup. So before you move large amounts to your own wallet, you must write down the seed phrase, store it in a safe place offline, and never share it with anyone.

Many Europeans use a hardware wallet for the bulk of their long-term BTC or ETH and keep a smaller amount on an exchange for convenience. That split balances security and usability. If you are new, start with a small test transfer to your own wallet and only move larger sums once you are comfortable with the process and backup.

## When an exchange is still the best option

If you actively trade or rebalance your portfolio, keeping a portion on a major exchange is practical. You can react to markets quickly, use limit orders, and avoid the fees and delay of moving funds on and off a hardware wallet for every trade. Regulated European exchanges offer SEPA, clear fee structures, and security features such as 2FA, anti-phishing codes, and withdrawal whitelists.

The key is to keep only the amount you need for trading and short-term moves on the exchange. Treat the rest as long-term savings and move it to a wallet you control. That way you get the convenience of the exchange without holding your entire stack there.

_Decision flow: exchange vs hardware wallet._ Use the flowchart above to decide. Active trading and small balances often suit an exchange; long-term holdings and larger amounts suit a hardware wallet with a secure backup.

## Recommended split and security basics

A common approach is to split by purpose and size. Keep roughly 10–20% of your crypto on the exchange (or whatever you need for the next few months of trading) and hold the rest in a hardware wallet. Use the exchange for deposits, withdrawals, and spot trading; use the hardware wallet for “cold” long-term storage. That way you are not overexposed to exchange risk, and you are not moving funds on-chain every time you want to trade.

Security on the exchange side: always enable two-factor authentication (2FA), use an authenticator app rather than SMS if possible, set an anti-phishing code, and use withdrawal whitelists so that only pre-approved addresses can receive withdrawals. On the wallet side: buy your hardware wallet from the official vendor, set it up yourself, write down the seed phrase on paper, store it offline in a safe place, and never share it or type it into a website or app. These habits significantly reduce the risk of both exchange hacks and self-custody mistakes.

_Layers of security._ Combine 2FA, withdrawal whitelists, and cold storage (hardware wallet) for a balanced setup. The chart above summarises the main layers; apply them on both exchange and wallet.

## Recommended tools

For long-term, self-custody storage, many Europeans use a hardware wallet from Ledger or Trezor. Both are well-known brands; buy only from the official website to avoid tampered devices. Set up the device yourself, back up the seed phrase offline, and never share it. This is not an endorsement of any specific product; do your own research and choose a wallet that fits your needs.

For trading and euro on-ramp, a regulated exchange with SEPA and low fees is useful. Binance is one option that many EU residents use for spot trading, deposits, and withdrawals.

Use it for the “exchange” part of your split; use a hardware wallet for the part you intend to hold long term.

## Conclusion

Where you store your crypto in Europe depends on how much you hold and whether you trade actively. Keeping everything on an exchange carries platform and solvency risk; holding everything in your own wallet puts full responsibility on you and requires a safe backup of your seed phrase. A practical approach is to keep a portion on a major exchange for trading and convenience, and hold the rest in a hardware wallet for long-term security. Enable 2FA and withdrawal whitelists on the exchange; back up your seed phrase offline for the wallet.
