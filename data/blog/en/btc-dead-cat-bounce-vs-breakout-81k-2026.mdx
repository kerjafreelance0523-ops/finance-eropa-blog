Bitcoin’s sharp rebound from the 50-week MA has raised the question: is this a dead cat bounce or the start of a real breakout? IG’s market navigator and other analysts point to the \$81K level as the test. Until Bitcoin reclaims \$81K, the rebound could be a dead cat bounce—a short-lived bounce before another leg down. If price reclaims \$81K and holds, the breakout thesis gains credibility. This article explains how to tell the difference between a dead cat bounce and a real breakout, the role of the \$81K test, and how Elliott Wave correction and RSI oversold bounce fit in. Fear of missing out crypto often peaks when price rips; waiting for the \$81K test reduces the risk of buying a dead cat bounce.

TradingView and FXEmpire have highlighted the \$85K–92K support zone and the \$81K reclaim. IG adds that the recent sharp rebound could be a dead cat bounce until \$81K is reclaimed; a wave C correction toward \$52K is possible if price fails. So the \$81K test is the filter: above it, the breakout thesis holds; below it, the dead cat bounce and Elliott Wave correction narrative stays in play. RSI oversold bounce has lifted price in the short term; the next step is either a reclaim of \$81K and a push higher, or a failure and a retrace toward support or lower. A trading plan that waits for the \$81K test—rather than chasing the RSI oversold bounce—reduces fear of missing out crypto by having a clear rule.

## Why the \$81K Test Separates Dead Cat Bounce from Breakout

A dead cat bounce is a short-lived rebound in a downtrend that fails to hold key levels. IG’s market navigator identifies \$81K as the level to reclaim for a bullish bias: until then, the recent sharp rebound could be a dead cat bounce. So the \$81K test is the line that separates a failed bounce from a real breakout. If price reclaims \$81K and holds, the RSI oversold bounce becomes the start of a new leg up. If price fails at resistance and breaks back below the 50-week MA, the dead cat bounce thesis is confirmed and the Elliott Wave correction scenario (e.g. wave C toward \$52K) becomes relevant. FXEmpire’s and TradingView’s focus on the \$85K–92K support band fits this: if price pulls back from the \$81K zone and holds \$85K–92K, the next attempt to reclaim \$81K gains credibility. If price breaks below support, the dead cat bounce is confirmed and the focus shifts to the 200-week EMA near \$68K.

FlorinCharts on TradingView has framed the Bitcoin weekly EMA 50 test with two scenarios: a reject and retrace toward \$85K–92K, or a break toward \$120K. The dead cat bounce is the reject scenario; the real breakout is the break scenario. The \$81K test is the first step toward the break scenario. So a trading plan that waits for a reclaim of \$81K before adding size is aligned with the data. Fear of missing out crypto tends to peak when price rips from oversold; discipline means waiting for the \$81K test to pass or fail.

## Data and Key Levels: Dead Cat Bounce vs Breakout

Concrete levels turn the \$81K test into a plan. IG cites \$72K–74K as resistance and \$81K as the level to reclaim for a bullish bias. TradingView and FXEmpire cite \$85K–92K as critical support. So we have a clear sequence: RSI oversold bounce has lifted price; \$72K–74K is the first resistance; the \$81K test is the bull/bear filter; \$85K–92K is support. If price reclaims \$81K and holds, the dead cat bounce thesis is rejected and the breakout thesis is on. If price fails at \$81K and breaks support, the dead cat bounce is confirmed and the Elliott Wave correction scenario (wave C toward \$52K) is in play. FinanceMagnates’ 25% drop toward \$68K fits the dead cat bounce and breakdown path. So the data supports using the \$81K test as the key filter and \$85K–92K as the support to watch. A trading plan that waits for the \$81K test—or for a pullback to support with a defined stop—reduces the risk of buying a dead cat bounce.

While many traders assume the rebound will hold, the data from IG and TradingView suggests that the \$81K test is the filter. The contrarian take is not to be bearish, but to wait for the \$81K test to pass or fail before adding. That reduces fear of missing out crypto by having a clear rule: no reclaim \$81K, treat the rebound as a possible dead cat bounce.

## Historical Context: Dead Cat Bounces and Breakouts

Historically, sharp rebounds from oversold conditions have sometimes been dead cat bounces and sometimes the start of new uptrends. The difference has often been whether price reclaimed key levels (like the equivalent of \$81K) and held. FXEmpire’s 2026 outlook notes that the 50-week EMA has in the past signalled a risk of deeper pullbacks when price has failed to hold key levels. So the current rebound can evolve in two ways: reclaim \$81K and breakout, or fail and confirm a dead cat bounce with an Elliott Wave correction toward \$52K or \$68K. The difference from past cycles is institutional flow and ETF context; the similarity is that key levels like \$81K and the weekly EMA 50 remain focal points. FinanceMagnates’ “healthy correction” narrative fits the view that a dead cat bounce and a test of the 200-week EMA can be part of a reset before a potential new rally. That kind of volatility is why waiting for the \$81K test matters more than chasing the RSI oversold bounce.

## Two Scenarios: Breakout Above \$81K vs Dead Cat Bounce

Forward-looking analysis splits into two main scenarios. In the first, Bitcoin reclaims \$81K and pushes toward \$90K and higher. The rebound then becomes a real breakout and the dead cat bounce thesis is rejected. In the second scenario, price fails at \$81K and retraces toward \$85K–92K or lower, confirming a dead cat bounce and possibly an Elliott Wave correction. Define your levels in advance so you are not caught off guard by either outcome.

Many analysts stress that defining your levels in advance and sticking to a plan for both outcomes reduces the risk of emotional decisions when volatility spikes. The key is to avoid chasing breakouts or panicking on breakdowns until the levels have clearly resolved. Using the \$81K test as your filter between dead cat bounce and real breakout keeps fear of missing out crypto in check.

Positioning for both—e.g. wait for a reclaim of \$81K before adding, or prepare to buy the dip at \$85K–92K if the \$81K test fails—keeps you from being wrong-footed. Macro events and volatility can push the outcome either way; having a plan for both breakout and dead cat bounce is the practical takeaway. Revisit your plan when price tests \$81K or the \$85K–92K support zone.

## Conclusion and Takeaways



Planning for volatility and sticking to key levels helps you avoid the trap of reacting to every short-term move. The goal is to align your actions with your strategy rather than with headlines or fear of missing out. Sticking to your plan when price approaches key levels helps you avoid reactive decisions; review your levels periodically and adjust only when they have clearly broken or held.

The sharp rebound from the 50-week MA could be a dead cat bounce or a real breakout; the \$81K test decides. Until Bitcoin reclaims \$81K, the rebound could be a dead cat bounce and the Elliott Wave correction scenario (e.g. wave C toward \$52K) stays in play. Key takeaways: (1) Use the \$81K test as the filter between dead cat bounce and breakout. (2) Wait for a reclaim of \$81K before adding size, or add only at \$85K–92K support with a defined stop. (3) Avoid fear of missing out crypto by waiting for the \$81K test. The RSI oversold bounce is context; the \$81K test is the next critical step in 2026. Revisit your plan when price tests \$81K or the \$85K–92K support zone.
