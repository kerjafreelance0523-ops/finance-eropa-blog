Many Europeans see viral screenshots of huge futures profits and jump in blindly. Understanding the difference between spot and futures can literally save your account.

**Risk warning:** Futures trading is highly leveraged and extremely risky. It is not suitable for beginners. You can lose more than your initial deposit, including your entire balance, in a short time. Only consider futures if you fully understand margin, liquidation, and leverage. When in doubt, stick to spot trading only.

Spot trading means you buy an asset (e.g. BTC or ETH) and own it; the price moves and your position moves with it. Futures are contracts that derive their value from the asset; you can use leverage to open a larger position with less capital, but you can be liquidated if the price moves against you. Below we define both, show a simple risk comparison, and explain where referral links fit for beginners versus advanced users.

## Spot trading defined

In spot trading, you buy Bitcoin or Ethereum (or another coin) with euros and hold it in your account. You own the asset. If the price goes up 20%, the value of your holding goes up 20%; if it goes down 20%, it goes down 20%. There is no leverage and no liquidation: you cannot lose more than the value of your position. Spot is the standard way beginners start: deposit euros, buy BTC or ETH, and hold or sell when you choose. On Binance, spot pairs like BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR are available with straightforward market and limit orders.

For most European investors, spot is enough to get exposure to crypto, benefit from long-term price moves, and avoid the complexity and risk of leverage. You can build a position over time with euro-cost averaging (DCA) or with single purchases. There are no margin calls or liquidations; the main risk is the volatility of the asset itself.

## Futures defined: leverage, margin, and liquidation

Futures contracts allow you to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning it. You post margin (collateral) and can open a position larger than your margin using leverage. For example, with 10x leverage, a 10% move in the price of BTC can double your margin or wipe it out, depending on direction. If your position moves against you enough, the exchange closes it automatically to protect itself—that is liquidation. You lose the margin you put up for that position.

A simple comparison: in spot, if BTC falls 20%, your €1,000 holding becomes €800. You still own the same amount of BTC. In futures with 10x leverage, a 10% move against you can lead to liquidation; you can lose your entire margin for that trade. So futures amplify both gains and losses and are not suitable for beginners or for money you cannot afford to lose. In the EU, regulators have pushed for leverage limits on retail crypto derivatives; platforms may cap leverage for European users. Always check the current rules on the exchange you use.

_Spot -20% vs futures 10x -10%: why liquidation happens._ In spot, -20% means your holding is worth 80% of what you paid. In futures with 10x, -10% can mean total loss of margin. The chart above is illustrative; never trade futures with money you cannot afford to lose.

## For beginners: start with spot only

If you are a beginner, start with spot trading only. You can [open a free Binance account using my referral link](https://www.binance.com/activity/referral-entry/CPA?ref=CPA_00CRAKDAW3) and practice with small amounts of EUR. Buy BTC or ETH in the spot market, get used to how orders and wallets work, and learn how volatility feels without leverage. Once you are comfortable with spot and understand the risks of leverage, you can decide whether futures are appropriate for you—and for most people, they are not.

Using the referral link gives you a fee discount on spot (and futures if you ever use them). The goal is to keep your first steps simple and safe: deposit euros, buy spot, and avoid leverage until you have done your own research and understand liquidation and margin.

## Futures for advanced users (strong disclaimer)

Futures trading is extremely risky and not suitable for beginners. You can lose your entire margin and more in a short time. If you fully understand the risks and still want to explore, Binance also offers futures markets. You can use [my link for a fee discount](https://www.binance.com/activity/referral-entry/CPA?ref=CPA_00CRAKDAW3), but never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. Many professional traders avoid leverage altogether; the ones who use it treat it as high-risk speculation and risk only a small fraction of their capital. Do not copy viral screenshots; they do not show the many accounts that were liquidated.

In the EU, MiCA and national rules may restrict or label crypto derivatives. Check your jurisdiction and the exchange’s terms. Even where allowed, leverage multiplies risk. Prefer spot for long-term exposure and use futures only if you have the experience and risk tolerance to handle liquidation.

_Risk spectrum: spot vs futures._ Spot is lower risk (no leverage, no liquidation); futures are higher risk (leverage, margin calls, liquidation). The chart above summarises the idea. Stay on the left side until you fully understand the right.

## EU regulation, leverage limits, and conclusion

In the European Union, crypto-asset regulation (MiCA) and national implementations affect how exchanges offer derivatives to retail users. Leverage limits and risk warnings are common. As a trader, you are responsible for knowing the rules that apply to you and for only using products you understand. When in doubt, use spot only.

In summary: spot means you buy and hold the asset; futures mean you trade contracts with leverage and risk liquidation. For EU traders, the practical takeaway is to use spot for exposure and learning, and to treat futures as high-risk speculation—or to avoid them entirely. To get started with spot and a fee discount, [create a Binance account via my referral link](https://www.binance.com/activity/referral-entry/CPA?ref=CPA_00CRAKDAW3). Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose. This is not financial advice.
