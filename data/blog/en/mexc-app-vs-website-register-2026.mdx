Should you register on MEXC using the website or the app? In 2026, both paths create the same account and lead to the same bonuses; the difference is where you start and which device you prefer. This guide compares the two options, lists pros and cons, and helps you choose the best way to register for your situation so you can sign up once and trade anywhere.

MEXC’s website works in any modern browser on desktop or mobile; no install is required. The app is a dedicated mobile application for iOS and Android, available from the official stores. Registration flow, security (KYC, 2FA), and referral programmes are the same on both. If you sign up on the website, you can log in on the app with the same credentials, and the other way around. So the “best” way is the one that fits your device and habits: desktop users often find the website faster to open and complete; mobile-first users may prefer the app for its interface and notifications. Whichever you choose, use a referral link such as the one in this article to unlock rewards of up to 10,020 USDT when you meet the deposit and trading conditions in 2026.

## Website Registration: Pros and Cons in 2026

Registering on the MEXC website (e.g. mexc.com or promote.mexc.fm for referral) has clear advantages if you are on a computer. You get a large screen and full keyboard, which can make typing email, password, and verification codes quicker. There is no download or install; you open the link, complete the form, and you are done. The website is also the same for everyone globally, so you can bookmark it and use it from any device with a browser. Many users in 2026 still prefer the website for the first-time sign-up and only install the app later for trading on the go.

The downside is that on a phone, the website can feel less smooth than the app because it is not optimised for touch in the same way. Also, if you close the browser tab before finishing, you must find the verification email or SMS again and re-enter the code. So the website is best when you have a stable connection and plan to complete the flow in one go, ideally on a desktop or laptop.

## App Registration: Pros and Cons in 2026

The MEXC app is built for mobile. Installing it from the official App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android) gives you a dedicated interface for sign-up and trading. On a phone, the app often feels faster and more responsive than the browser; form fields and buttons are sized for touch, and you can switch between the app and your SMS or email app easily to grab the verification code. After registration, the app is also where you will get push notifications for 2FA, security alerts, and price updates, which many traders find useful in 2026.

The trade-off is that you must download and install the app first. If you are on a restricted network or have limited storage, that can be a hurdle. Always download from the official MEXC listing in the store; do not use third-party or sideloaded copies, as they can be fake and steal your credentials. Once installed, the app and website share the same account; you can use both with one sign-up.

## Who Should Choose Which in 2026

If you mainly use a desktop or laptop and want to avoid installing anything, register on the website. Open the referral or main MEXC link in your browser, complete the form, verify with the code from your email or phone, and set your password. You can add the app later for mobile access. If you are on a phone and plan to trade from it often, the app can be the better first step: install from the store, open the app, and go through the same sign-up flow. Your account will then be ready on both app and web.

If you are unsure, a simple rule in 2026 is: same device you will use most for trading. Desktop traders start on the website; mobile traders start on the app. You can always log in on the other channel later; there is no need to register twice.

## Data: Same Security and Bonuses on Both Channels

MEXC does not treat website and app sign-ups differently for security or bonuses. KYC and 2FA are available on both; verification status and limits apply to your account regardless of where you log in. Referral and new-user programmes in 2026 also credit rewards to the same account whether you signed up on the web or in the app, as long as you used the referral link or code. So the only real difference is the interface and device; the outcome is the same.

This is good news: you do not have to worry that choosing one channel will lock you out of rewards or features. Choose what is convenient, complete the flow, and then use either the website or the app (or both) with the same login.

## Conclusion: One Account, Two Ways to Register

In 2026, the best way to register on MEXC is the one that fits your device and habits. The website is ideal for desktop users and those who prefer no install; the app is ideal for mobile users and those who want push notifications and a native experience. Both create the same account and unlock the same referral and welcome rewards when you use a partner link and meet the deposit and trading conditions.

You can start on either channel with this link: [Register on MEXC (website or app) and get up to 10,020 USDT in referral rewards in 2026](https://promote.mexc.fm/r/Ou26wUQm).
