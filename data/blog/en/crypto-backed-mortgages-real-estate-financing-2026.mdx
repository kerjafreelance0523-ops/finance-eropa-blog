In 2026, buying or refinancing real estate no longer requires selling your Bitcoin or Ethereum. Lenders such as Newrez, Newfi Lending, and LendFriend have rolled out programs that accept cryptocurrency as a qualifying asset or as collateral, so you can keep exposure to crypto while securing a mortgage. According to Newfi and industry reports, eligible borrowers can use a portion of their crypto holdings—often 25% to 50% of reserve requirements—without triggering a taxable sale. This shift reflects a broader trend: crypto holders are being treated as well-capitalized investors rather than speculative retail traders. This article explains the two main approaches (qualifying asset versus collateral), the data behind current rates and reserves, and how to use them in your financing plan for 2026.

The distinction between “crypto as qualifying asset” and “crypto as collateral” matters for both risk and cost. When crypto is used as a qualifying asset, you demonstrate ability to repay without locking the coins; the lender does not take a security interest in the crypto, so there is no margin call if prices drop. When crypto is used as collateral, you pledge the assets and borrow against them—typically at higher rates (often 13% to 15% for short-term crypto-backed loans) and with margin-call risk. Refinancing from a high-interest crypto-collateral loan into a long-term mortgage at 6.5% to 8.5% can cut borrowing costs and remove annual fee resets. LendFriend and similar providers frame this as a way to diversify into real estate without liquidating crypto; the data from 2026 lender guidelines supports that narrative for borrowers who qualify.

## Data and Source: Two Models and the Numbers

As shown in the chart below, lenders in 2026 generally offer two paths: crypto as a qualifying asset (used to meet reserve or income requirements without liquidation) and crypto as collateral (borrow against pledged assets with margin-call risk). Newrez’s Smart Series programs—including SmartSelf, SmartEdge, and SmartVest for investors—allow eligible crypto to count toward qualification without selling. Newfi Lending’s DSCR program accepts up to 25% of Bitcoin and Ethereum held in Coinbase and up to 50% of crypto mutual funds or ETFs from traditional providers, capped at a combined 50% of total reserve requirements. These figures come directly from lender guidelines and housing-wire coverage in 2026. The implication is that a borrower with substantial crypto can satisfy reserve tests and still hold the assets, avoiding capital-gains tax and preserving upside.

Rates tell a parallel story. Short-term crypto-collateral loans often charge 13% to 15% with 2% to 4% annual origination fees, while crypto-friendly mortgages sit in the 6.5% to 8.5% range for fixed-rate terms. Refinancing from the former to the latter can materially reduce interest expense and eliminate fee resets. The institutional crypto-backed lending market has been estimated at around $24 billion; that scale has encouraged traditional and specialty lenders to formalize underwriting that treats crypto as a legitimate part of a borrower’s balance sheet. So the data supports two practical points: qualifying-asset use is expanding, and refinancing out of high-rate crypto loans into mortgages is a viable path for those who meet program criteria.

## Historical Context: From “Sell First” to Qualifying Asset

Before 2024, the default assumption was that buying a house with crypto gains meant selling, paying tax, and then using the proceeds for a down payment or reserves. Today, that assumption no longer holds. Lenders have moved from treating crypto as an oddity to accepting it as a qualifying asset for mortgage and DSCR programs. The change mirrors the institutionalization of crypto: custody solutions, ETFs, and regulated products have made it easier for underwriters to verify holdings and apply haircuts. The difference between then and now is that “then” you had to choose between keeping crypto or buying property; “now” you can do both, provided you use programs that accept crypto for qualification rather than only for collateral. The similarity across time is that risk management still matters—volatile collateral can trigger margin calls, whereas qualifying-asset treatment keeps the home and the crypto separate.

Some lenders still offer only collateral-based crypto loans. Those products serve a different need: quick liquidity without selling, often at higher cost and with ongoing exposure to margin calls. The 2022 crypto lending crisis, where platforms offering 70% to 90% loan-to-value collapsed, underscored the danger of over-leverage. Sustainable structures in 2026 typically use much lower LTVs (e.g., 30%) for collateral or avoid collateral altogether in favor of qualifying-asset underwriting. So the historical lesson is that the safer path for long-term real estate financing is the qualifying-asset route where your home is not tied to crypto price moves.

## Contrarian Angle: You Don’t Have to Sell to Buy

While many assume you must sell crypto to buy or refinance real estate, 2026 lender data suggests otherwise. Newrez, Newfi, and LendFriend explicitly allow crypto to count toward reserves or qualification in various programs. The popular narrative is “cash out crypto to get a mortgage”; a closer look at program guidelines shows that selling is one option, not the only one. Using crypto as a qualifying asset typically costs about 0.5% to 1.5% more than a conventional mortgage, but it avoids triggering a taxable event and lets you keep exposure to Bitcoin or Ethereum. For holders with large unrealized gains, that trade-off can be worthwhile. The contrarian take is not that everyone should use crypto to qualify—it is that the option exists and is increasingly standardized, so dismissing it out of hand can leave money and flexibility on the table.

Critics argue that relying on crypto for qualification is risky if prices fall. That is true for collateral-based borrowing, where margin calls can force sales. For qualifying-asset programs, the crypto is not pledged; the lender is only verifying that you have sufficient reserves or assets to support the loan. So a drop in crypto prices does not directly trigger a default or foreclosure on the home. The risk that remains is personal: if you were counting on crypto to fund future payments and prices fall, your liquidity may be strained. The data from 2026 does not show that qualifying-asset programs have led to higher delinquency; the structural separation between the house and the crypto is the key.

## Forward-Looking Scenarios: Rates and Volatility

Two main scenarios matter for planning. In the first, mortgage rates drift lower in 2026 (e.g., Fed cuts or softer inflation). Refinancing from a high-rate crypto-backed loan into a long-term mortgage becomes more attractive; locking in a fixed rate removes both interest and fee-reset risk. In the second scenario, crypto volatility stays high while rates stay elevated. Then the priority shifts to choosing the qualifying-asset path over the collateral path—so that home and loan are not tied to margin calls. In both cases, the implication is to know which model your lender uses and to prefer programs that do not pledge your home against crypto collateral if you want to sleep well during drawdowns.

Borrowers who already have short-term crypto loans can run the numbers: compare the all-in cost of the current loan (interest plus fees) with the projected cost of a crypto-friendly mortgage. If the mortgage rate is several points lower and the term is longer, refinancing can be optimal. Those still planning a first purchase can ask lenders upfront whether they accept crypto as a qualifying asset and what haircuts or caps apply. Forward-looking, more lenders may join Newrez and Newfi in accepting crypto for DSCR and conventional programs, but program details will continue to vary by jurisdiction and investor type.

## Conclusion and Takeaways

Crypto-backed mortgages in 2026 offer a way to finance real estate without selling Bitcoin or Ethereum. Two models dominate: crypto as a qualifying asset (no liquidation, no margin call, typically 0.5%–1.5% premium over conventional) and crypto as collateral (higher rates, margin-call risk). Data from Newrez, Newfi, and LendFriend shows that 25%–50% of reserves can come from eligible crypto in certain programs, and that refinancing from 13%–15% crypto loans into 6.5%–8.5% mortgages is available for qualified borrowers. The historical shift from “sell first” to “qualify with crypto” reflects institutionalization and better custody; the contrarian point is that selling is not mandatory. Plan for two scenarios: lower rates making refinance attractive, and high volatility making the qualifying-asset route preferable to collateral.

Key takeaways: (1) Use crypto as a qualifying asset where possible to avoid margin calls and taxable sales. (2) Compare refinancing from high-rate crypto loans into fixed-rate mortgages when rates allow. (3) Confirm with lenders whether they use qualifying-asset or collateral models and what caps apply. Crypto-backed real estate financing in 2026 is a growing niche; matching the product to your risk tolerance and tax situation is the practical next step.
