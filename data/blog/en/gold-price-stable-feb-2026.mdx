Gold has held in a relatively stable range in the first half of February 2026, with neither a sharp breakout nor a sustained sell-off. Here’s a short recap of the main factors and what to watch.

## Why gold has been range-bound

- **Rates and the dollar** – Real yields and the US dollar often move inversely to gold. As long as they stay in a narrow band, gold can too.
- **Central bank demand** – Ongoing official-sector buying has provided a floor under the market but hasn’t been enough to push prices sharply higher.
- **Geopolitical tension** – Uncertainty supports safe-haven demand but hasn’t escalated enough to trigger a strong rally.

## What could break the range

- A clear shift in Fed or ECB policy (more dovish or more hawkish) could move real yields and the dollar, and thus gold.
- A major geopolitical or financial stress event could boost haven demand.
- A strong move in risk assets (e.g. equities) could pull capital away from gold or, in a sell-off, push it toward gold.

## Takeaway

Stability in gold in February 2026 reflects balanced forces: steady central bank interest and modest haven demand against a stable rate and dollar environment. Watch rates, the dollar, and risk sentiment for clues to the next big move.
