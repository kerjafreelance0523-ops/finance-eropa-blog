First time signing up for a crypto exchange? MEXC in 2026 is built so new users can go from zero to a verified account with a clear path. This guide explains what each step means, what to prepare before you start, and how to avoid the mistakes that slow beginners down. By the end you will know exactly what to expect and how to unlock your first bonuses.

Exchanges like MEXC ask for contact details, a password, and sometimes identity verification so they can meet regulations and keep your account secure. None of this is unique to MEXC; the difference is how fast and clear the flow is. In 2026, MEXC offers both website and app sign-up, supports email or phone, and runs referral programmes that can add up to 10,020 USDT in rewards when you sign up through a partner link and complete deposit and trading steps. Understanding the flow before you click helps you finish in one go and claim those benefits.

## What to Prepare Before You Sign Up

Gather a few things so you are not stuck mid-flow. You need a valid email address or phone number that you can access right away; MEXC will send a verification code to it. Use an address or number you control and check regularly, including the spam folder for email. Next, decide on a strong password: at least 10 characters, with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and a symbol. Write it down in a safe place or use a password manager; you will need it every time you log in. If you plan to verify your identity (KYC), have a government-issued ID such as a passport or national ID card and be ready to take a clear photo or upload a scan. Finally, if someone gave you a referral link or code, keep it handy so you can enter it during sign-up and qualify for bonus rewards from day one.

Having these ready cuts down on back-and-forth and avoids the frustration of having to leave the flow to find a document or reset a forgotten password. Many beginners in 2026 report that preparation takes a few minutes but saves much more once they start the actual registration.

## Step-by-Step: What Each Part of Sign-Up Means

The first screen asks for your email or phone number. This becomes your main login identifier and the place where MEXC sends security codes and important notices. Choose one and stick to it; you can add the other later in account settings if needed. After you enter it, you will see a puzzle or captcha; this is to block bots. Solve it and click to receive the verification code. The code usually arrives within a minute; if it does not, check spam for email or wait a bit longer for SMS. Enter the code in the field and continue. Do not share this code with anyone; MEXC will never ask for it by email or phone.

Next you create your password. The rules (length and mix of characters) are there to protect your account from guessing and simple attacks. After you set it, you may see an optional “Referral code” or “Invite code” field. If you have a link like the one in this article, the code is often already in the URL; otherwise paste it here. This links your account to the referrer and can unlock bonus rewards when you deposit and trade. Then accept the terms and privacy policy and submit. Your account is created; you can log in immediately. To raise limits and unlock withdrawals, go to the account or security section and complete identity verification (KYC) and two-factor authentication (2FA). KYC means uploading your ID and sometimes a selfie; 2FA means adding a second check (e.g. an app or SMS) when you log in or withdraw. Both are standard in 2026 and greatly improve security.

## Common Beginner Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

The biggest mistake is rushing without reading. Skipping the referral field means you may miss thousands of USDT in welcome and referral rewards if you would have qualified. Entering the wrong email or phone means you cannot receive the verification code and must start over or contact support. Using a weak or reused password increases the risk of your account being compromised. Another common error is closing the tab or app before finishing verification; then you have to find the email or SMS again and re-enter the code. Complete the flow in one session on a stable connection.

Beginners sometimes think they must verify identity before they can do anything. On MEXC in 2026, you can sign up and log in without KYC, but limits and features (e.g. withdrawals) are restricted until you verify. So the practical approach is: finish sign-up first, then do KYC and 2FA when you are ready to trade or withdraw. Do not skip 2FA; it is one of the most effective ways to protect your account.

## Why Verification and Security Matter for New Users

Exchanges operate under regulations that require them to know who is using their platform. KYC is how MEXC meets those rules and reduces fraud. For you, it unlocks higher limits and full features. Two-factor authentication adds a second layer: even if someone gets your password, they cannot log in without your phone or authenticator app. In 2026, account takeovers and phishing are still common; strong passwords and 2FA significantly reduce your risk. Taking a few extra minutes at sign-up to set these up is one of the best habits a beginner can build.

MEXC’s help centre and in-app prompts guide you through KYC and 2FA. If a step is unclear, use only official MEXC links and support channels; do not follow instructions from random social media or messages, as those are often scams.

## Conclusion: Your First MEXC Account in 2026

As a beginner, signing up for MEXC in 2026 is straightforward if you prepare and follow the flow. Have your email or phone, a strong password, and optionally your ID and referral code ready. Complete each step in order, enter the referral code if you have one, and do not close the window until you are done. Then add KYC and 2FA to secure your account and unlock full access.
