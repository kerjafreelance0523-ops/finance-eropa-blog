Want to turn your MEXC sign-up into real rewards? In 2026, MEXC runs referral and new-user programmes that can add up to 10,020 USDT in bonuses when you register through a partner link and complete simple deposit and trading steps. This guide breaks down what is on offer, how to qualify, and how to make sure you do not miss out by signing up without a referral link.

The key is using the right link from the start. If you register on the main MEXC site without a referral or invite code, your account is not linked to any bonus programme and you may not get the extra rewards even if you later deposit and trade. By contrast, signing up via an official referral link (such as the one in this article) ties your account to the programme so that when you meet the conditions—typically a minimum deposit of 100 USDT and at least one futures trade—you and sometimes your referrer can receive rewards. MEXC’s 2026 promotions have included sign-up vouchers, position airdrops, and referral bonuses; the exact amounts and tasks can change, so always check the current terms on the promotion page.

## What You Can Get: 2026 Bonus and Referral Overview

MEXC’s 2026 new-user and referral offers often include several layers. Sign-up and app download can give you a small voucher (e.g. 20 USDT total). Depositing at least 100 USDT and trading a minimum volume (e.g. 1,000 USDT in futures) can unlock larger rewards: position airdrops (e.g. 60 USDT or more), deposit bonuses, and referral rewards. In some periods, the combined cap for referral and new-user rewards has been advertised up to 10,020 USDT, with 10,000 USDT from referral rewards and 20 USDT from the invite bonus. The referrer also benefits: for example, 20 USDT per qualified friend who deposits 100 USDT and completes at least one futures trade within the required window (e.g. seven days), with a cap per event round (e.g. 100 USDT for five friends).

These numbers are based on public MEXC announcements and support pages for 2026. Programmes may vary by region and time; the structure above illustrates the type of rewards and tasks. Checking the official MEXC invite or promotion page when you sign up ensures you see the latest conditions.

## How to Sign Up and Activate Your Bonus

First, register using a referral link. The link already contains the referral code, so you usually do not need to type it manually. Complete the normal sign-up flow: email or phone, verification code, and password. After your account is created, log in and complete identity verification (KYC) if the programme requires it; many 2026 bonuses need KYC before you can withdraw or claim rewards. Then make a deposit of at least the minimum (often 100 USDT or equivalent). Use a supported network and asset to avoid delays. Next, place at least one futures trade as specified in the current promotion; some offers require a minimum volume (e.g. 1,000 USDT). Once these steps are done within the time limit (e.g. seven days from sign-up), rewards are typically credited automatically to your account.

If you have already signed up without a referral link, you usually cannot retroactively attach a code to that account. So the single most important step is to use the referral link before you create your account. Bookmark or open the link in a new tab, then go through the registration form without closing it.

## Data: How Referral and Welcome Rewards Work in 2026

MEXC’s referral programme in 2026 is designed so both sides win. The new user gets welcome bonuses and sometimes a trading-fee discount; the referrer earns a fixed amount per qualified friend (e.g. 20 USDT) and in some periods a share of the friend’s trading fees. “Qualified” normally means the new user has deposited the minimum amount and completed the required trading task within the promotion window. Limits apply: for example, a referrer might earn up to 100 USDT per two-week event round based on the first five qualified referees. Rewards are often credited the day after the qualifying trade.

This structure encourages real usage rather than empty sign-ups. For you as a new user, it means your first deposit and first trade are not only the start of your trading journey but also the trigger for unlocking the bonus. Planning that first deposit and trade within the deadline is part of maximising what you get from the programme.

## Why Use a Referral Link Instead of Going Direct?

Some people assume that signing up on the main MEXC site is “cleaner” or that referral links are only for the referrer. In practice, the referral link is how MEXC attributes your account to a campaign. Without it, you may still get generic new-user offers, but you can miss the larger referral and welcome rewards that are tied to the partner programme. Using an official referral link does not cost you anything; it only adds the possibility of extra bonuses and sometimes fee discounts. The referrer’s gain does not reduce yours; MEXC funds these rewards separately.

So the rational choice in 2026 is to sign up via a referral link if you plan to deposit and trade anyway. You get the same account, the same platform, and the chance to unlock up to 10,020 USDT in rewards. The only wrong move is to register without a link and then wish you had.

## Conclusion and Your Next Step

MEXC’s sign-up bonus and referral rewards in 2026 can add meaningful value when you register through a partner link and complete the required deposit and trading steps. Understand the current offer (sign-up voucher, deposit and volume tasks, referral bonus), use the referral link before creating your account, then complete KYC, deposit, and trade within the time window to activate your rewards.
