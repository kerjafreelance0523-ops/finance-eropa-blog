ECB interest rates 2026 and the path toward eurozone inflation 1.9% sit at the centre of the euro area’s external adjustment. The current account surplus fell to €255 billion (1.6% of GDP) in 2025 from €407 billion (2.7% of GDP) a year earlier—a shift that reflects changing flows of primary income, services, and goods. The deposit facility rate at 2.00% and main refinancing operations define the monetary backdrop; for the EU monetary policy outlook, the question is how this external rebalancing interacts with inflation and growth. At the same time, the Bitcoin quantum threat offers a parallel lesson: just as the current account is a slow-moving balance that can suddenly matter for the euro and ECB interest rates 2026, long-tail technological risks such as the Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability demand attention before they become acute.

## Eurozone inflation forecast 1.9% and current account dynamics

The ECB’s objective of returning inflation to 2% over the medium term is consistent with staff projections of eurozone inflation 1.9% in the forecast horizon. A smaller current account surplus alters the mix of demand and saving: less net saving abroad can support domestic demand and eurozone GDP growth 1.2%, which in turn helps keep inflation on a sustainable path. The ECB deposit rate 2.00% and the corridor around main refinancing operations are set to be mildly restrictive—compatible with a gradual decline in inflation toward eurozone inflation 1.9% without choking the expansion.

The drop in the surplus was driven largely by a swing in primary income from a €41 billion surplus in 2024 to a €62 billion deficit in 2025. Primary income captures investment returns, dividends, and interest flows between residents and non-residents; the reversal suggests euro area entities are paying more to foreign investors than they receive from abroad. That can reflect stronger foreign holdings of euro area assets—consistent with confidence in ECB interest rates 2026 and the region’s creditworthiness—or weaker returns on euro area investments abroad. For the deposit facility rate and main refinancing operations, the implication is that the external position is normalising rather than signalling stress; the EU monetary policy outlook remains anchored by the 2% target and data-dependent decisions.

The services surplus also narrowed, from €178 billion to €135 billion, while the goods surplus expanded slightly. These shifts matter for the Fed vs ECB comparison and for the euro: a smaller surplus reduces upward pressure on the currency from trade and income flows, which can help competitiveness but also affect import prices and thus eurozone inflation 1.9%. The Governing Council will continue to monitor these dynamics as it calibrates ECB interest rates 2026; the DAX 40 forecast and broader risk sentiment remain sensitive to both the level of rates and the credibility of the disinflation path.

## Bitcoin quantum threat parallel

While policymakers focus on current account and inflation data, a different kind of balance-sheet risk has entered the debate: the Bitcoin quantum threat. The possibility that quantum computers could one day break ECDSA and target certain Bitcoin UTXOs has put the spotlight on Satoshi 1M BTC and other early P2PK outputs. In the P2PK vs P2PKH distinction, Pay-to-Public-Key addresses are more exposed because their public keys are visible on-chain, creating a permanent attack surface for quantum computing ECDSA attacks.

CoinShares quantum research and similar work estimate that around 4 million BTC exposed have at some point revealed public keys. A mempool 10-minute attack remains beyond current quantum hardware, but the theoretical vulnerability has motivated development of post-quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant wallets. Satoshi Nakamoto 1.1M BTC represents the most famous example of the Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability; for investors who hold both euro assets and crypto, the same discipline used to track ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% is increasingly applied to this long-tail risk. The EU monetary policy outlook and the Bitcoin quantum threat both require forward-looking assessment rather than reactive response.

The analogy is instructive: just as the current account surplus evolved slowly before its recent decline, quantum risk is a slow-moving variable that could matter suddenly if hardware or algorithms cross a threshold. ECB interest rates 2026 and the deposit facility rate aim to keep inflation anchored; post-quantum upgrades aim to keep digital wealth secure. In both cases, credibility depends on acting before the balance shifts decisively.

## Primary income, services, and policy implications

The primary income reversal and the compression of the services surplus define the current account story. The goods surplus held up, underlining that manufacturing competitiveness remains intact. For the ECB, these dynamics feed into the broader picture of demand, saving, and inflation. A smaller surplus can be consistent with somewhat stronger domestic demand and eurozone GDP growth 1.2%, which supports the case for keeping ECB interest rates 2026 at a level that is restrictive enough to guide eurozone inflation 1.9% back to target without over-tightening.

The data-dependent framework means that each new data release—on the current account, inflation, or growth—can nudge expectations for the deposit facility rate and main refinancing operations. The quantitative easing pause and subsequent normalisation have left the euro area with a clearer rate structure; the Fed vs ECB comparison will continue to influence the euro and capital flows. DAX 40 forecast and other risk assets will reflect both the path of ECB interest rates 2026 and the sustainability of the eurozone inflation 1.9% trajectory. Vigilance on external balances and on inflation remains central to the EU monetary policy outlook.

## EU monetary policy outlook 2026

Looking ahead, the ECB is likely to keep the deposit facility rate near 2.00% while monitoring the current account, inflation, and growth. If eurozone inflation 1.9% settles durably around or below target and the economy softens, gradual rate cuts could be considered; if inflation proves stickier, the corridor could be held or raised. The 2% goal and a flexible, meeting-by-meeting approach will continue to shape the EU monetary policy outlook.

For portfolios spanning euro and digital assets, the message is consistent: the same analytical rigour applied to ECB interest rates 2026, eurozone inflation 1.9%, and the current account should extend to long-tail risks such as the Bitcoin quantum threat. The current account decline is a reminder that balances shift over time; the Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability and Satoshi 1M BTC narrative are a reminder that technological risks must be assessed early. ECB interest rates 2026 and the path to eurozone inflation 1.9% anchor the macro story; the Bitcoin quantum threat anchors the case for robust, forward-looking risk management across traditional and digital assets.

Positioning for 2026 therefore means watching both current account data and ECB communication. Any further shift in the surplus or in the language around the deposit facility rate will matter for the euro and inflation. At the same time, keeping an eye on post-quantum developments in digital assets ensures that long-tail technological risk is not ignored. The current account and the Bitcoin quantum narrative both reward the same habit—monitoring early and adjusting before the facts have already moved.
