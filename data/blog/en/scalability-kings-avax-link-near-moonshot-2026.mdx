What if the narrative of an "Ethereum killer" is the wrong frame? Money.com and institutional analysts point to Solana's high TPS and CME futures, Chainlink's oracle role, and Avalanche and Algorand as ETH rivals. The real story for 2026 may be DeFi scalability solutions and best Layer2 crypto adoption: chains and oracles that complement Ethereum rather than replace it. This article looks at why buy Avalanche AVAX, Chainlink oracle staking, and NEAR protocol buy themes fit that picture, the data behind throughput and adoption, and a contrarian take on the "moonshot" label.

## Data and Sources: Throughput, Oracles, and L2 Adoption

Money.com's roundup of the best cryptos to buy for 2026 highlights Solana for its high TPS and CME futures listing, and Chainlink for its role as the dominant DeFi oracle. It also flags Avalanche and Algorand as Ethereum rivals with strong L2 and scalability profiles. Bitwise's 2026 outlook ties institutional adoption and regulatory progress to broader crypto strength, which benefits infrastructure plays like oracles and high-throughput chains. The implication is that the best Layer2 crypto and DeFi scalability solutions are not about one chain winning but about multiple networks and Chainlink oracle staking serving different use cases: payments, DeFi, and enterprise. Data on transaction throughput and TVL growth supports that view.

When you consider a NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX, you are betting on adoption of alternative execution layers and data availability. Chainlink oracle staking ties LINK to the security and demand for off-chain data feeding smart contracts. Institutional interest in CME-listed products and regulated access tends to favour established names first, but DeFi scalability solutions and Layer2 innovation create room for AVAX, LINK, and NEAR in a diversified 2026 allocation.

## Historical and Macro Context: From Single-Chain to Multi-Chain

In earlier cycles, the focus was on one smart-contract leader. Today, the narrative has shifted to a multi-chain and modular world: Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, NEAR, and others, with oracles like Chainlink connecting them. Money.com and Bitwise both emphasise institutional adoption and regulatory clarity as drivers for 2026; that environment tends to reward both blue-chip chains and infrastructure such as the best Layer2 crypto and Chainlink oracle staking. Historically, periods of high gas costs on Ethereum accelerated interest in DeFi scalability solutions and alternative chains, which supports the case for a NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX as part of a diversified portfolio.

At the same time, macro and risk appetite matter. If rates stay higher for longer or risk-off sentiment returns, speculative names can underperform. So the historical lesson is that DeFi scalability solutions and best Layer2 crypto adoption can support long-term value, but the path is unlikely to be a straight line. A buy Avalanche AVAX or NEAR protocol buy allocation fits a multi-year theme rather than a short-term trade.

The chart below summarises how AVAX and LINK have traded relative to broader L2 and oracle narratives. Money.com and Bitwise both point to infrastructure and scalability as 2026 themes; the best Layer2 crypto and Chainlink oracle staking fit that view. Investors eyeing a NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX should consider volatility and time horizon as part of DeFi scalability solutions allocation. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Data source: Money.com, The 8 Best Cryptos to Buy for 2026; Bitwise, 2026 predictions. The chart illustrates how AVAX and LINK have traded relative to broader L2 and oracle narratives; use it for context, not as a forecast. A NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX fits a multi-year DeFi scalability solutions theme. Investors should consider volatility and time horizon when sizing the best Layer2 crypto and Chainlink oracle staking exposure.

High TPS and low latency matter for user experience and cost. The diagram below contrasts high-throughput chains with Ethereum mainnet. As DeFi scalability solutions mature, the best Layer2 crypto and oracle infrastructure become critical. Chainlink staking and NEAR's sharding design are examples of how the stack evolves. Use this for a long-term view on DeFi scalability solutions rather than a short-term tactical trade. Size positions to risk tolerance and horizon.

Data source: Public chain metrics, 2026. Relative performance of Layer2 and oracle tokens depends on adoption and macro; a NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX fits a multi-year scalability theme. Use DeFi scalability solutions and best Layer2 crypto exposure as part of a long-term thesis rather than a short-term tactical trade; size positions to risk tolerance and horizon accordingly.

## Contrarian Angle: "Ethereum Killer" Overstates the Case

While many headlines frame Layer2 and alt-L1s as "Ethereum killers," the data suggests a more nuanced picture. Money.com and Bitwise highlight Solana, LINK, AVAX, and ALGO as part of a broader crypto resurgence, not as zero-sum replacements for ETH. Chainlink oracle staking and oracle demand are complementary to Ethereum and other chains; they do not require one chain to "win." The contrarian take is therefore not to dismiss the best Layer2 crypto or DeFi scalability solutions, but to avoid the narrative that only one chain will capture all value. A NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX can be a bet on a multi-chain future where LINK and other oracles are key infrastructure.

Where the narrative understates the case is adoption speed. CME futures for Solana and growing institutional interest in crypto infrastructure suggest that the best Layer2 crypto and DeFi scalability solutions are moving from niche to mainstream. Chainlink staking and NEAR's developer growth are examples. So the contrarian angle is twofold: do not overstate a single "moonshot" winner, but do not ignore the structural shift toward multi-chain and oracle-dependent DeFi that benefits AVAX, LINK, and NEAR over time.

## Forward-Looking Scenarios: Two Paths for 2026

Two scenarios frame the range of outcomes. In an optimistic case, regulatory clarity and sustained institutional adoption lift the whole sector; the best Layer2 crypto and DeFi scalability solutions see strong TVL and usage growth, and a buy Avalanche AVAX or NEAR protocol buy or Chainlink oracle staking allocation benefits from both adoption and scarcity. In a more conservative case, adoption is slower and volatility remains high; prices hold above 2025 lows but do not break out sharply in the first half of 2026. A later breakout would depend on a second wave of institutional adoption or a favourable macro shift. The practical implication is that DeFi scalability solutions and best Layer2 crypto exposure are scenario-dependent; size a NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX position to risk tolerance and horizon, and treat Chainlink oracle staking as a long-term infrastructure hold rather than a short-term trade.

## Conclusion and Takeaways

Money.com and Bitwise suggest that 2026 can favour infrastructure and scalability: Solana (TPS, CME), Chainlink (oracle), and chains like Avalanche and Algorand as ETH rivals. That supports a constructive view on the best Layer2 crypto and DeFi scalability solutions, with buy Avalanche AVAX, Chainlink oracle staking, and NEAR protocol buy as ways to get exposure. Historically, the shift to multi-chain and oracle-dependent DeFi is structural; the caveat is that regulation and adoption pace matter and short-term volatility is likely. Two scenarios—optimistic (strong TVL and usage) and conservative (consolidation first, breakout later)—frame the range. Takeaways: (1) Use DeFi scalability solutions and best Layer2 crypto as a long-term thesis. (2) Watch adoption metrics and regulatory progress. (3) Treat a NEAR protocol buy or buy Avalanche AVAX as scenario-based and size accordingly; consider Chainlink oracle staking for oracle exposure.
