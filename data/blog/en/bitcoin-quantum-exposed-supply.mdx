ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% define the macro backdrop against which investors hold Bitcoin and other risk assets. With the deposit facility rate at 2.00% and the EU monetary policy outlook data-dependent, the DAX 40 forecast and risk sentiment influence allocation. At the same time, the **Bitcoin quantum threat** has put the spotlight on how much Bitcoin is really exposed to quantum attacks. Claims that “a quarter of all Bitcoin” is vulnerable can be misleading without a clear picture of P2PK vs P2PKH, address reuse, and the 4 million BTC exposed estimates. From the Satoshi 1M BTC scenario to the broader Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability, understanding the real attack surface is essential. This article zooms in on exposure while keeping ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% as the macro context.

## Eurozone inflation 1.9% and risk-asset context

The ECB’s 2% inflation target and staff projections of eurozone inflation 1.9% set the tone for financial conditions. The ECB deposit rate 2.00% and main refinancing operations form the rate corridor; the deposit facility rate anchors short-term rates. When ECB interest rates 2026 are stable and eurozone inflation 1.9% is on track, risk sentiment often supports flows into Bitcoin. The Fed vs ECB comparison and eurozone GDP growth 1.2% influence the EU monetary policy outlook. For holders assessing how much Bitcoin is exposed to quantum attacks, the macro backdrop does not change the technical exposure, but it does affect the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin and the resources the ecosystem can devote to post-quantum preparedness. ECB interest rates 2026 and the path of eurozone inflation 1.9% remain part of the full picture. The chart below shows how eurozone inflation 1.9% and the ECB deposit facility rate interact with risk-asset conditions.

## Bitcoin quantum threat: P2PK vs P2PKH and exposed supply

Quantum computers do not attack Bitcoin’s total market cap; they attack specific outputs where public keys are already visible on-chain. Binance estimates that 25%–30% of BTC, roughly 4 million coins, sit in addresses with exposed public keys. CoinShares takes a narrower view: around 1.6–1.7 million BTC (about 8% of supply) are in legacy Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) outputs that are permanently exposed—the core of the **Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability**. Within that pool, only about 10,000 BTC are in UTXOs large enough to move markets if suddenly stolen; the rest are split across tens of thousands of smaller outputs. The Satoshi 1M BTC wallets are the most famous example of the Bitcoin quantum threat; CoinShares quantum research and similar work help quantify the 4 million BTC exposed figure when address reuse is included.

Modern address types—P2PKH, P2SH, and SegWit—hide the public key behind a hash until spend; the key is only visible in a short mempool window. An attacker would need to run Shor’s algorithm fast enough to beat the next block, which is far beyond realistic quantum hardware for at least the next decade. The real soft spot is address reuse: every reuse re-exposes the same public key. Using fresh addresses and migrating away from legacy P2PK dramatically shrinks the attack surface. Post-quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant wallets are the long-term answer; in the meantime, operational hygiene reduces exposure. The figure below illustrates P2PK vs P2PKH exposure and how post-quantum wallets change the risk profile.

## Concentrated exposure and practical implications

Bitcoin’s quantum exposure is concentrated, not systemic. It lives in pockets of old and poorly managed UTXOs, not in the entire 21 million coin supply. With relatively simple changes—no address reuse, upgrading old wallets, consolidating legacy outputs—most of the realistic quantum risk can be pushed to the margins long before it becomes exploitable. The mempool 10-minute attack remains theoretical; quantum computing ECDSA attacks are a long-term risk, not a 2026 event. For institutions and individuals, the same discipline used to assess ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% should extend to the Bitcoin quantum threat: focus on where exposure actually is (P2PK, reuse) and act accordingly.

## EU monetary policy outlook 2026 and takeaways

Over the coming year, the ECB is likely to keep the deposit facility rate near 2.00% while monitoring eurozone inflation 1.9% and growth. The EU monetary policy outlook will remain data-dependent. For investors, the lesson is consistent: the same analytical rigour applied to ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% should extend to the Bitcoin quantum threat.

How much Bitcoin is exposed to quantum attacks is a function of address design and behaviour; the 4 million BTC exposed and Satoshi 1M BTC narratives are reminders to improve hygiene and support post-quantum readiness. ECB interest rates 2026 anchor the macro story; the Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability and post-quantum migration path anchor the technological story.
