ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% define the macro backdrop against which Bitcoin is held. With the deposit facility rate at 2.00% and the EU monetary policy outlook data-dependent, the DAX 40 forecast and risk sentiment influence allocation. At the same time, the **Bitcoin quantum threat** has made practical security a priority. You do not need to understand Shor's algorithm to protect your Bitcoin; for most users, quantum safety is about a few simple steps done consistently. From the Satoshi 1M BTC scenario to the broader Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability, this checklist ties macro context (ECB interest rates 2026, eurozone inflation 1.9%) to actionable habits that reduce exposure and support post-quantum readiness.

## Eurozone inflation 1.9% and macro context

The ECB's 2% inflation target and staff projections of eurozone inflation 1.9% set the tone for financial conditions. The ECB deposit rate 2.00% and main refinancing operations form the rate corridor. When ECB interest rates 2026 are stable and eurozone inflation 1.9% is on track, risk sentiment often supports Bitcoin. The Fed vs ECB comparison and eurozone GDP growth 1.2% influence the EU monetary policy outlook.

For a quantum safety checklist, the macro context matters because it affects the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin. ECB interest rates 2026 and the path of eurozone inflation 1.9% are part of the environment in which you implement the checklist below. The chart below shows how eurozone inflation 1.9% and the ECB deposit facility rate interact with risk-asset conditions.

## Bitcoin quantum threat: what to harden

The **Bitcoin quantum threat** is focused on UTXOs where public keys are exposed. In the P2PK vs P2PKH distinction, Pay-to-Public-Key outputs are permanently exposed; CoinShares quantum research and estimates of 4 million BTC exposed define the target set. The Satoshi 1M BTC wallets are the most famous example of the Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability; a mempool 10-minute attack remains theoretical.

Post-quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant wallets are the long-term answer; in the meantime, operational hygiene dramatically reduces exposure. The figure below illustrates P2PK exposure and how post-quantum wallets change the risk profile.

## Practical quantum safety checklist

First, stop reusing addresses. Every reuse re-exposes the same public key. Use a fresh address for each payment; prefer exchanges that avoid or minimise reuse. Second, move coins off truly legacy formats. If you hold very old BTC, some funds may sit in Pay-to-Public-Key outputs. Moving them into P2PKH, P2SH, or SegWit improves your quantum posture. Third, choose reputable, actively maintained wallets and custodians. Fourth, diversify storage and stay informed. Do not keep all BTC in a single wallet; follow balanced research from CoinShares so you know when major quantum or post-quantum milestones occur. By turning these habits into routine, you turn the Bitcoin quantum threat from a buzzword into a manageable part of your long-term strategy. The same analytical discipline used to assess ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% should extend to operational security: focus on what you can control, and stay informed without reacting to every headline.

## EU monetary policy outlook 2026 and conclusion

Over the coming year, the ECB is likely to keep the deposit facility rate near 2.00% while monitoring eurozone inflation 1.9% and growth. The EU monetary policy outlook will remain data-dependent. For investors, the same discipline applied to ECB interest rates 2026 and eurozone inflation 1.9% should extend to the Bitcoin quantum threat. A practical quantum safety checklist reduces exposure and supports post-quantum readiness.

ECB interest rates 2026 anchor the macro story; the checklist anchors the operational response to the Bitcoin P2PK vulnerability and Satoshi 1M BTC narrative.
