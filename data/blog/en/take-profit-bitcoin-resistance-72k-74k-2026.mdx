Bitcoin’s bounce from the 50-week MA has lifted price toward resistance. IG’s market navigator and other analysts point to the \$72K–74K zone as where tactical longs often take profit after an RSI oversold bounce. Until Bitcoin reclaims \$81K, the trend remains in question; the take profit Bitcoin retrace approach is to lock in gains at resistance and wait for either a pullback to support or a confirmed breakout before adding again. This article summarises why the \$72K–74K resistance matters, how it fits with the RSI oversold bounce and the \$81K reclaim, and how to use a take profit Bitcoin retrace strategy without FOMO when price extends.

TradingView and FXEmpire have highlighted support at \$85K–92K and the importance of the \$81K reclaim. IG adds that the recent sharp rebound could be a dead cat bounce until \$81K is reclaimed; in the meantime, resistance at \$72K–74K is the first major level where profit-taking tends to appear. So the sequence for a take profit Bitcoin retrace strategy is: consider taking profit or trimming at \$72K–74K, then wait for either a pullback to \$85K–92K support or a clear reclaim of \$81K before adding. That avoids chasing and keeps risk under control when Bitcoin choppy range behaviour returns.

## Why \$72K–74K Is a Take Profit Bitcoin Retrace Zone

After an RSI oversold bounce, price often runs into the first major resistance before deciding the next move. IG’s market navigator identifies the \$72K–74K area as that resistance: the recent sharp rebound from oversold conditions has lifted Bitcoin toward this zone, and until price reclaims \$81K the bias can remain bearish for trend followers. So the take profit Bitcoin retrace approach is to treat \$72K–74K as a zone to lock in gains or reduce exposure, rather than to add. If price then pulls back to support (\$85K–92K) or breaks above \$81K, you have room to re-enter with a clearer trend signal. FXEmpire’s and TradingView’s focus on the \$85K–92K support band and the \$81K reclaim fits this: the \$72K–74K resistance is the first hurdle on the way up, and many tactical players will use it to take profit before the next leg is confirmed.

FlorinCharts on TradingView has framed the Bitcoin weekly EMA 50 test with two scenarios: a reject and retrace toward \$85K–92K, or a break toward \$120K. The reject scenario implies that price could rise toward \$72K–74K, fail there, and then retrace toward support. So taking profit at \$72K–74K is consistent with the view that a retest of support is possible before a sustained move higher. The RSI oversold bounce has done its job; the next step is either consolidation or a clear breakout above \$81K.

## Data and Key Levels: Resistance and Reclaim

Concrete levels turn the take profit idea into a plan. IG cites \$72K–74K as resistance and \$81K as the level to reclaim for a bullish bias. TradingView and FXEmpire cite \$85K–92K as critical support. So we have a clear sequence: resistance at \$72K–74K (take profit or trim), reclaim of \$81K (bull/bear filter), and support at \$85K–92K (buy-the-dip zone). A take profit Bitcoin retrace strategy uses these levels to define where to reduce exposure and where to look for re-entry. FinanceMagnates’ and IG’s note that a break below the 50-week MA can lead to a test of the 200-week EMA near \$68K is the downside scenario; if price fails at \$72K–74K and breaks support, that path becomes relevant. So the data supports using \$72K–74K as a take profit zone and \$81K as the next confirmation level.

While many traders hold through resistance hoping for more, the data from IG and TradingView suggests that the RSI oversold bounce often meets profit-taking at the first major resistance. The contrarian take is not to be bearish, but to take profit at \$72K–74K and wait for a pullback or a reclaim of \$81K before adding again. That fits a disciplined take profit Bitcoin retrace approach and reduces the risk of giving back gains in a Bitcoin choppy range.

## Historical Context: Resistance and Retrace

Historically, the first major resistance after an oversold bounce has often been tested before price either breaks out or retraces. FXEmpire’s 2026 outlook notes that the 50-week EMA has in the past signalled a risk of deeper pullbacks, but those have often been preceded by a bounce and sideways action. So the current move toward \$72K–74K can be followed by a retrace to support or a breakout above \$81K. The difference from past cycles is institutional flow and ETF context; the similarity is that resistance zones and the weekly EMA 50 remain focal points. FinanceMagnates’ “healthy correction” narrative fits the view that a retrace from \$72K–74K toward \$85K–92K or lower is a normal part of the process. That kind of volatility is why a take profit Bitcoin retrace strategy—locking in gains at resistance and waiting for the next clear signal—matters more than holding through every pullback.

## Two Scenarios: Break Above \$81K vs Retrace to Support

Forward-looking analysis splits into two main scenarios. In the first, Bitcoin takes out \$72K–74K resistance and reclaims \$81K, then challenges \$90K and higher. In that case the RSI oversold bounce becomes the start of a new leg up and the take profit Bitcoin retrace opportunity was early. In the second scenario, price fails at \$72K–74K and retraces toward \$85K–92K or lower. 

Many analysts stress that defining your levels in advance and sticking to a plan for both outcomes reduces the risk of emotional decisions when volatility spikes. The key is to avoid chasing breakouts or panicking on breakdowns until the levels have clearly resolved. A take profit Bitcoin retrace approach at \$72K–74K and a re-entry plan at support or reclaim \$81K keeps risk under control.

A take profit Bitcoin retrace approach at \$72K–74K and a re-entry plan at support or reclaim \$81K keeps risk under control.

Positioning for both—e.g. take profit at \$72K–74K and plan to re-enter on a pullback to support or a confirmed reclaim of \$81K—keeps you from being wrong-footed. Macro events and volatility can push the outcome either way; having a plan for both breakout and retrace is the practical takeaway. Revisit your plan when price tests \$72K–74K or reclaims \$81K before adding size.

## Conclusion and Takeaways



Planning for volatility and sticking to key levels helps you avoid the trap of reacting to every short-term move. The goal is to align your actions with your strategy rather than with headlines or fear of missing out. Sticking to your plan when price approaches key levels helps you avoid reactive decisions; review your levels periodically and adjust only when they have clearly broken or held.

The \$72K–74K resistance zone is where tactical longs often take profit after an RSI oversold bounce. Until Bitcoin reclaims \$81K, the trend remains in question. A take profit Bitcoin retrace strategy uses \$72K–74K as a zone to lock in gains, then waits for either a pullback to \$85K–92K support or a confirmed reclaim of \$81K before adding again. Key takeaways: (1) Treat \$72K–74K as a take profit or trim zone. (2) Use the \$81K reclaim as the bull/bear filter before adding size. (3) Keep \$85K–92K support in mind for re-entry on dips. The RSI oversold bounce has lifted price; the next step is to manage risk at resistance and wait for confirmation. Revisit your plan when price tests \$72K–74K or reclaims \$81K.
