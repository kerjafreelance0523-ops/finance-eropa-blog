With MiCA regulations and new EU rules, choosing the right exchange is more important than ever. Here is a transparent comparison of the main platforms Europeans actually use.

In 2026, European crypto users need exchanges that support euro deposits and withdrawals (ideally SEPA), comply with EU regulation where applicable, and offer clear fees and a wide enough selection of coins and features. Below we compare five popular options: Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and one smaller EU-focused platform. We look at trading fees, deposit and withdrawal costs, payment methods, number of coins, and key features so you can decide which fits you.

## Comparison: fees, SEPA, and features

The table below summarises the main criteria. Exact fees and limits change; always check each exchange’s website for current numbers.

| Exchange   | Trading fee (approx.)           | EUR deposit/withdraw | SEPA | Card | Coins (approx.) | Notable features                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---- | ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Binance    | Low (tiered, referral discount) | Often free/low       | Yes  | Yes  | 600+            | Earn, Staking, Launchpad, Auto-Invest |
| Kraken     | 0.16–0.26% (maker/taker)        | SEPA free            | Yes  | Yes  | 200+            | Staking, good for EUR pairs           |
| Coinbase   | 0.4–0.6% (standard)             | SEPA free            | Yes  | Yes  | 200+            | Simple UI, custody, institutional     |
| Bitstamp   | 0.3–0.5%                        | SEPA free            | Yes  | Yes  | 80+             | Long-standing, EU-focused             |
| eToro (EU) | Spread-based                    | SEPA, various        | Yes  | Yes  | 80+             | Copy trading, social, stocks + crypto |

**Binance** offers very competitive spot fees, especially with a referral discount, and supports SEPA and card. It has a large number of coins, Earn (savings/staking), Launchpad for new tokens, and Auto-Invest for DCA. Some users find the interface dense; others like the depth. **Kraken** is popular among Europeans for its strong EUR liquidity and clear fee schedule. **Coinbase** is known for a simple onboarding and custody options. **Bitstamp** is one of the oldest EU-friendly exchanges with a straightforward offer. **eToro** mixes crypto with stocks and copy trading, which can suit users who want a single app for multiple assets. Each has pros and cons; your choice depends on whether you prioritise lowest fees, simplicity, or specific features.

## Why I personally use Binance for most of my trades

For my own euro-denominated trading and on-ramp, I use Binance for a few objective reasons: high liquidity and many EUR pairs, low spot fees especially with a referral discount, SEPA and card deposits, and features like Auto-Invest and Earn that fit a long-term and DCA approach. It is widely used in Europe, which means good depth of order books and support. That does not mean it is the only good option—Kraken and Coinbase are solid alternatives depending on whether you prefer their fee structure or interface. But for combination of fees, liquidity, and features, Binance fits my use case.
